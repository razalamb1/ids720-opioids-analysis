Over the past two decades, opioid use and abuse in the United States have been increasing. As part of our group project in our MIDS, Practical Data Science class, we analyzed the effects of policy changes designed to limit abuse of prescription opioid drugs and mortality from drug overdoses. 
We focused on three policies implemented in the states of Florida, Texas, and Washington beginning in 2010, 2007, and 2012. To answer the question 
of the effect of opioid drug regulations on the volume of opioids prescribed and drug overdose deaths, we gathered data from their sources:
opioid prescription drug shipment data from US Drug Enforcement Agency published by Washington Post (2006-2012), mortality due to drug and non-drug
Related causes from US Vital Statistics records (2003-2015), county population data from US Vital Statistics records for 2000 and 2010. We decided to use total active weight in grams in prescription opioid shipment data to represent opioid shipment for each transaction. For the mortality data, 
we picked Drug/Alcohol-related deaths to represent overdose deaths. We formatted our data at the state-county-year level and normalized by county's population.
	 
We graphed mortality and prescription data across years to visualize policy changes' effect on the three states' abuse parameters. 
In addition, we chose a control group where there were no policy changes, but the trends of overdose mortality and prescription opioid shipments were similar before the policy. We analyzed how the opioid abuse parameters diverged between the state of interest and the control group after the policy 
the change took place.
